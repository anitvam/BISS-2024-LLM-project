\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Several social network platforms - such as Telegram, 4chan, and Parler - do not employ strong moderation
policies, causing the proliferation of conspiracy theories in many contexts, like COVID-19 or the war
in Ukraine, and thus diffusing dangerous ideas and generating social harm among their communities.
%
In this paper, we present the process to fine-tune two \acp{llm} architectures
on an Italian dataset from an EVALITA challenge, that requires identifying
conspiracy theories in posts coming from Telegram.
%
We provide details about the two adopted architectures, the model configuration and the training
process adopted in our experiments.
%
%\meta{Briefly summarise the finding of the experiments}
Results show that our proposed models outperform both the baseline provided by the organizers on kaggle and 
the results of the same models without fine-tuning.
\end{abstract}

\section{Task description}\label{sec:task-description}
We conducted a comparative study between \emph{Encoder-based} and \emph{Decoder-based} architectures
on the same task.
%
Specifically, we worked on the \emph{\ac{acti}}~\footnote{\url{https://russogiuseppe.github.io/ACTI/}}
task, that requires identifying conspiracy theories coming from lax moderated policies platforms like
Telegram, 4chan, and Parler.
%
We focused on the \emph{Subtask A}, where a system must recognise if a Telegram post is conspiratorial
or not.
%
To be flagged as conspiratorial, a post must:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman{*})]
  \item express the belief that major events are controlled by and/or manipulated by powerful people protecting their interests; or
  \item interpret events in a way that supports conspiracy theories.
\end{enumerate*}
A sentence is considered conspiratorial even if it shares some claims intended to undermine commonly accepted views on societal issues.

\section{Dataset description}\label{sec:dataset-description}
The dataset for \ac{acti}-A is in CSV format and contains three columns, namely:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
  \item \textbf{id}: represents a unique identifier for the post;
  \item \textbf{comment\_text}: contains the raw text written in the post; and
  \item \textbf{conspiratorial}: represents a binary label where 0 indicates that the post is not conspiratorial,
    while 1 indicates conspiratorial content.
\end{enumerate*}
The dataset is split into two separate CSV files: one, meant for the training process, lists
1842 records, while the other includes 460 posts for testing purposes.
%
Notably, since the subtask was part of a challenge, the second dataset did not contain the
\textbf{conspiratorial} column by default.
%
Therefore, the test set was initially labelled by computing the encoding of each sentence using an auxiliary LLM,
and subsequently, a clustering algorithm was employed in the latent space.
%
However, after an analysis, we noticed that several sentences had been mislabeled.
%
Fortunately, the \ac{acti} team was kind enough to provide the
missing labels upon our request.

\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related-work}

The \ac{acti} task \cite{russo2023actievalita2023overview} was part of the EVALITA 2023 initiative
\cite{lai2023evalita} \footnote{\url{https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3473/}}. EVALITA is a periodic evaluation campaign
of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and speech tools for the Italian language, and the year 2023 saw its 8th
edition, with its first one dating back to 2007.

Eight teams tackled the \ac{acti}-a subtask in EVALITA 2023, with F1-scores ranging from $0.78$ to $0.85$. While
the the two best-performing teams, namely UPB \cite{paraschiv2023upbactidetecting} and extremITA
\cite{hromei2023extremita}, submitted a \ac{llm}-based solution, other teams approached the problem with methods
based on transformers and ensembles, but still managed to pass the $0.80$ accuracy mark. In particular,
\cite{giobergia2023acti} tried both a single-task and a multi-task approach, testing three fine-tuned models:
Italian ELECTRA \cite{9514855}, BART-IT \cite{fi15010015}, and Italian BERT \cite{stefan-it-italian-bertelectra}.
They used these encoder-based models to compute embeddings of the given input, then fed the result to a classifier
for labelling. \cite{vitali2023acti} adopted a similar approach, but also used data augmentation techniques on the
data sets, obtaining relevant improvements in subtask A specifically.

\section{Architecture overview}\label{sec:architecture-overview}
To tackle the \ac{acti}-A subtask, we explored two alternative architectures: an encoder-based one, and
a decoder-based one. Both are detailed in this section.

\subsection{Encoder}
Encoder-based classifiers, among which BERT \cite{devlin-etal-2019-bert} is the most famous one, require the
pre-processed input text to undergo a tokenization process, where each sequence of tokens gets also prepended
with a \texttt{[CLS]} token, left-padded up to the maximum sequence length, or truncated down to it if longer.
For tasks that require splitting the input in multiple parts, an additional \texttt{[SEP]} token can be used.

Processed by the hidden encoding layers, each applying self-attention and passing the result to a feed-forward
neural network, input tokens are transformed into contextual embeddings, as shown in \Cref{fig:encoder-block}. Notably, we are only interested in
the final hidden state corresponding to the \texttt{[CLS]} token, that contains an aggregate representation of
the entire input sequence, and can be fed to a linear classifier to obtain the probability distribution of the
input belonging to one of the classes.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/encoder-block.pdf}
  \caption{
    An encoder block, composed by a self-attention layer and a feed forward neural network.
  }
  \label{fig:encoder-block}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Decoder}
The decoder-based architecture we adopted is very similar to the encoder one, employing a tokenizer, followed
by the decoder model, with a classification layer on top.

For the tokenization process, the main difference when compared to the encoder solution is the absence of the \texttt{[CLS]} token. 
In fact, due to the autoregressive nature
of decoder-only models, the last token is used to make the prediction, instead of the first.

\Cref{fig:decoder-block} shows the input passing through multiple decoder blocks, each composed by a masked 
self-attention layer and a feed-forward neural network. The masking makes it so each token only attends to previous tokens in the sequence, maintaining a unidirectional context. The final hidden state, corresponding to the last
token in the sequence, is fed to the linear layer on top of the stack of decoders. Its output dimension is equal to 
the number of labels of the given task.
%
Alternatively, and less commonly, a special token's embedding or an aggregation of all token embeddings can be
used as input for the classifier.

\end{figure}

\section{Experimental setup}\label{sec:experimental-setup}

\subsection{Preprocessing}\label{sec:preprocessing}
The preprocessing stage is a fundamental part in preparing the dataset for fine-tuning a \ac{llm}.
%
This process ensures that the data is clean, consistent, and in a format suitable for the next stages.
%
The same preprocessing procedure has been applied for both the models taken into account in \Cref{sec:model-config}.
%
In the following,
we report the steps we adopted for the preprocessing stage.

\paragraph{Dataset exploration}
We used Pandas~\cite{reback2020pandas} to build a DataFrame from the CSV dataset files,
for extracting information and data manipulation.

Preliminary,
a dataset exploration is performed to understand the categorical labels' distribution,
and the posts' length provided in the dataset.
%
\Cref{fig:class-frequency} depicts the class distribution for the \emph{training set} (left chart),
and the \emph{test set} (right chart).
%
Notably,
both the classes for the training and test set are well-balanced,
requiring no rebalancing countermeasure.

Another aspect we are interested in is the post length distribution,
since we are limited in the number of token each model can accept.
%
\Cref{fig:words-distribution} shows the distribution of the posts' length divided by training and test set.
%
The two upper charts provide the distribution on the raw post of both the dataset,
while the two lower charts describe the distribution after the clean-up step (that we will discuss in the next paragraph).
%
As can be observed,
the majority of the posts are concentrated in the range $0-500$ words,
meaning that the most of the dataset will not be truncated when input to the model.
%
The posts' clean-up process do not significantly impact the length distribution of the posts in the datasets.

\paragraph{Text cleaning}
To remove noise from the input data,
we processed the raw posts to remove any irrelevant content for the model's fine-tuning.
%
In particular,
we conducted the following operations:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman{*})]
  \item remove all the extra space;
  \item remove HTML tags and special characters like \texttt{@};
  \item remove all the http links; and
  \item remove all the \texttt{\#} but preserving the text associated to the hashtag.
\end{enumerate*}
Then,
the dataset is updated with the cleaned version of the posts,
preserving the same file structure.

  \caption{
    Comment length distribution for both the training dataset (on the left) and test dataset
    (on the right).
    %
    The upper charts refer to the raw content of posts, coming from the original dataset;
    in the lower charts, our cleanup preprocessing has been applied to the content.
  }
  \label{fig:words-distribution}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Model configuration}\label{sec:model-config}
While solving ACTI-A subtask, we also compared performances of two different Transformer-based architectures,
the first one based on an \emph{Encoder} neural network, and the second one on a \emph{Decoder} neural network.

\paragraph{Encoder}

We adopted a RoBERTa-based Language Model named \texttt{UmBERTo Commoncrawl Cased},
which is trained on the large italian subcorpus of \texttt{OSCAR project} ~\footnote{\url{https://oscar-project.org/}}.
%
To address the chosen challenge, we added to this model a final layer for classification,
which returns a value for each class specified,
in our case two classes, for identifying if a text is conspiratorial or not.

Before training the model on our subtask we performed preprocessing, as described in \Cref{sec:preprocessing},
and then tokenization (\Cref{fig:preprocessing-and-tokenization-encoder}).
%
Concerning tokenization, \texttt{CamembertTokenizerFast} is adopted,
it normalizes strings input both regarding delimiters of the text,
but also adds a left-side padding where the input is smaller than the maximum sequence length,
that we fixed at $ 256 $ characters.
%
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/encoder.pdf}
  \caption{
    Input manipulation before passing it to the encoder LLM model.
    The image exemplifies the manipulation output obtained after the clean-up process and the application of the tokenization function.
  }
  \label{fig:preprocessing-and-tokenization-encoder}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Decoder}

The decoder model adopted to be fine-tuned is a small \texttt{OpenAI GPT2} model adapted to italian language~\cite{de-vries-nissim-2021-good}.
%
Similarly to the encoder configuration,
text is preprocessed and then tokenized before being served to the model.
%
Oppositely from the encoder,
text tokenization is performed using \texttt{GPT2Tokenizer}
and configured to add the padding on the right side of the text input (\Cref{fig:preprocessing-and-tokenization-decoder}).
%
This is made because, given the architecture of a decoder model,
the last token of the input sequence is used to make predictions about the next token that should follow the input,
this means that the last token of the input sequence contains all the information needed in the prediction.
%
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/decoder.pdf}
  \caption{
    Input manipulation before passing it to the decoder LLM model.
    The image exemplifies the manipulation output obtained after the clean-up process and the application of the tokenization function.
  }
  \label{fig:preprocessing-and-tokenization-decoder}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Training process}\label{sec:training-process}
During the training phase, we focused on fine-tuning two distinct models: one was encoder-only and the
  other was decoder-only (as described in~\Cref{sec:model-config}).
  We leveraged the libraries PyTorch~\cite{NEURIPS2019_9015} and HuggingFace for this process.
  To maintain consistency, we applied the same hyperparameters to both models, which included:
  \begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman{*})]
    \item $4$ epochs of fine-tuning;
    \item a maximum sequence length of $256$; and
    \item a batch size of $16$.
  \end{enumerate*}
  The only variation was in the learning rate, where we used $2 \cdot 10^{-5}$ for the encoder and $5 \cdot 10^{-5}$ for the decoder.
  Notably, we chose those values of maximum sequence length and batch size due to the memory constraints of the available GPUs.
  Finally, we used the cross-entropy loss.

  }
\end{table}

We evaluated the performance of our classification models using the $F_1 score$. 
Table \ref{table:results} displays the performance of our proposed model, 
along with additional scores for comparison to provide further insights into the results. 
The $F_1 scores$ were computed on the labelled test set provided by the organizers of the ACTI task.
The Kaggle baseline $F_1 scores$ is 0.5107, while the EVALITA winners achieved 0.8572. 
Our initial models, without any tuning, achieved $F_1 scores$ of 0.4538 and 0.3189 for the encoder-only 
and decoder-only configurations, respectively. After fine-tuning, the $F_1 scores$ improved to 0.8211 and 0.7464.
Comparing the results, we observe that our proposed models significantly 
outperform the baseline ($ +0.3104 $ and $+0.2357$) but do not reach the performance level of the EVALITA winners.
Figure \ref{fig:confusion-matrix} shows the confusion matrices resulting from 
the test set classifications for both proposed models. 
Encoder-only matrix indicates that this model has a good 
performance in identifying "Conspiratorial" instances but has some difficulties in 
correctly identifying "Non-Conspiratorial" instances, as evidenced by the number of false positives. 
Instead, examining the decoder-only matrix, we observe that the number of false positives 
remains similar to the encoder-only model. However, the number of false negatives increases 
significantly, surpassing the number of false positives. 
This increased difficulty in correctly identifying positive instances 
results in a lower $F_1 score$ for the decoder-only model.
